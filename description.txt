Useful Jungle Mimic [c/FFCC73:Reboot!] Mod offers the opportunity the jungle mimic to appear naturally throughout your world in the subterranean jungles.

This mimic, unlike the rest, will only appear if you have defeated the 3 mechanical bosses, so it will have more life and more damage (but also better loot!).

This mod compared to the mod that I previously made on the same theme, has several improvements over the previous mod and these are:

- More original weapons with better sprites.
- It no longer requires an intermediary npc to appear (if you played the original mod you will understand).
- Among other things that maybe I forgot

Hope you enjoy this "QOL" mod!

Future Features:

- Make the summoning system of the other mimics work
